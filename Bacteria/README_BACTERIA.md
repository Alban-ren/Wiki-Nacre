# Analysis of the bacterial taxonomic composition in tissues of Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In parallel with the transcriptomic analysis of Pinna nobilis, a study of the bacterial diversity associated with the mantle tissues of these organisms was conducted to determine whether the bacterial communities differ between healthy individuals and those infected by the parasite Haplosporidium pinnae. To this end, output files generated by Kraken2 (see [Kraken2](./Kraken_2.md#Kraken2) section), containing the bacterial taxa identified in the transcriptomes, were used as a basis for analysis. Each output file lists the bacterial taxa detected and the number of reads assigned to each.

In the [bash script](Scripts_bash/Script_binary_table.sh), a minimum threshold of 10 reads was established to reduce the likelihood of false positives due to taxonomic misassignments. This threshold is arbitrary, as there is currently no consensus regarding metagenomic identification in non-targeted transcriptomic datasets generated by Illumina sequencing.

Bacterial taxa with read counts equal to or above this threshold were selected and used to construct a presence/absence matrix. In this matrix, columns represent the different samples and rows correspond to the identified bacterial taxa. The presence of a taxon in a sample is marked with a “1” in the corresponding cell, while its absence is marked with a “0”. The full script used to generate this matrix is available in the “[Script bash bacteria](./Script_bash_bacteria.sh)” section.

The resulting binary matrix summarizes the presence or absence of bacterial taxa across samples. The objective is to compare bacterial diversity among samples in relation to biological, ecological, or geographic factors. Beta diversity analysis is particularly appropriate for this type of data, as it quantifies variation in species composition between samples or sites of interest (Legendre & De Cáceres, 2013).

To visualize the dispersion index of our samples, we use the RStudio environment to perform beta diversity analysis and generate visualizations based on a binary presence/absence matrix of bacterial taxa. This approach allows us to analyze bacterial taxonomic diversity between samples and to conduct statistical tests assessing β-diversity differences across multiple sample groups. Since our samples originate from various localities (France, Spain, Greece, and Italy), we were able to compare bacterial community compositions across these geographic groups.

To examine these variations, a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) is conducted. A PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) test is then applied to determine whether community structures (i.e., taxonomic compositions) differ significantly between groups, using ecological distances and a permutation-based approach. A test for homogeneity of dispersions is performed afterward to validate the reliability of the PERMANOVA results. Finally, a pairwise PERMANOVA is conducted to compare compositional differences between groups in a multivariate framework. The results of this test are visualized using a heatmap. The complete script used here is available in the “[Script R bacteria](./script_R_bacteria.R)” section.
