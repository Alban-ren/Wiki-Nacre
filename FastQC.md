## FastQC
FastQC is a bioinformatics tool designed to assess the quality of high-throughput sequencing data, particularly those generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. These technologies produce millions of reads per run, making preliminary quality control a critical step prior to any downstream bioinformatic analysis (Andrews,2010)).
FastQC identifies a variety of technical artifacts, including duplicated sequences, sequence composition biases, potential contamination, and provides a comprehensive assessment of base quality scores (Phred scores). Performing this quality check helps detect anomalies that may introduce biases or affect the reliability of downstream analyses within the pipeline.
Input files must be in .fastq, .fastq.gz, or .fq format. Upon completion, FastQC produces two main output files:

An interactive HTML report that visually summarizes key quality metrics, including per-base Phred score distribution, read length distribution, GC content, sequence duplication levels, and more.
*ex :

A .zip archive containing all raw data and detailed analytical results in plain text format (.txt), which can be further explored or integrated into automated workflows.

In our case, FastQC was used after the application of Kraken2 to assess the quality of the reads, and again following trimming with Trimmomatic to evaluate data quality prior to assembly. You can see the entire script we used for our sample in the [experiment](./Experiment_01.md#experiment-script) section.
