Recent studies have highlighted an expansion of TIR-DC proteins in bivalves, reflected by an increase in the number of genes encoding TIR-DC proteins, including both transmembrane TLR receptors and intracellular TIR-DC proteins (Gerdol et al., 2017). Bivalve TLRs are characterized by a high structural diversity, including atypical combinations of TIR and LRR domains, potentially allowing broader recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Gerdol et al., 2017). Bivalves possess a large number of intracellular TIR-DC proteins, whose structures differ from known vertebrate adaptors such as MyD88, TRIF, TRAM, and SARM. Among these proteins, several novel families, called ecTIR-DC, have been identified, suggesting potentially new roles in immune signaling, independent of the classical MyD88-TRIF pathways (Gerdol et al., 2017). This diversification may be explained by lineage-specific gene expansion events in bivalves, likely in response to specific pressures of the marine environment, thus promoting the emergence of new proteins capable of detecting and responding to pathogens (Gerdol et al., 2017).
