# Wiki noble pen shell
------------------------
This wiki has been created as part of a research project investigating the impact of the protozoan parasite *Haplosporidium pinnae* on the transcriptome of noble pen shell populations (*Pinna nobilis* and *Pinna rudis*). The study is conducted under the supervision of Stéphane Coupé.

The main objective of this study is to identify transcriptomic mutations in *P. nobilis* and *P. rudis* in response to infection by the protozoan parasite *Haplosporidium pinnae*, through transcriptomic comparison between healthy and infected individuals.

*H. pinnae* is a parasitic protozoan that infects the Mediterranean endemic bivalve *Pinna nobilis* (and its closely related species *Pinna rudis*), commonly known as the noble pen shell (Linnaeus, 1758). This infection is responsible for mass mortality events (MMEs) in noble pen shell populations and facilitates the entry of other pathogenic organisms, contributing to a multifactorial disease (Coupé et al., 2022).
Although some cases of resistance in *P. nobilis* and tolerance in *P. rudis* and *P. nobilis* × *P. rudis* hybrids have been reported, the latter two appear to be naturally resistant to the parasite (Coupé et al., 2022).

It is important to study gene expression differences and potential variations in transcribed RNAs, both between species and between individuals with different sensitivities to *Haplosporidium pinnae*.


# In this wiki, you will find:

* The different pipelines used for genome assembly of *Pinna nobilis* (see the [README_GENOMIC](genomics/README_GENOMIC.md) section),

* Explanations of the software and computational tools employed in these analyses (see the [genomic](genomics/) section),

* The code used for genome-related analyses (see the [script](genomics/Script_classification.md) section).

You will also find similar explanations and scripts related to the identification of bacterial communities associated with *Pinna nobilis* and *Pinna rudis* tissues in the [bacteria](Bacteria/) section.
