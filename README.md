# Wiki noble pen shell
------------------------
This wiki has been created as part of a research project investigating the impact of the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae on the transcriptome of noble pen shell populations (Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis). The study is conducted under the supervision of Stéphane Coupé.

The main objective of this study is to identify transcriptomic mutations in P. nobilis and P. rudis in response to infection by the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, through transcriptomic comparison between healthy and infected individuals.

Haplosporidium pinnae is a parasitic protozoan that infects the Mediterranean endemic bivalve Pinna nobilis (and its closely related species Pinna rudis), commonly known as the noble pen shell (Linnaeus, 1758). This infection is responsible for mass mortality events (MMEs) in noble pen shell populations and facilitates the entry of other pathogenic organisms, contributing to a multifactorial disease (Coupé et al., 2022).
Although some cases of resistance in P. nobilis and tolerance in P. rudis and P. nobilis × P. rudis hybrids have been reported, the latter two appear to be naturally resistant to the parasite (Coupé et al., 2022).

In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying tolerance and resistance, it is important to investigate genomic variations both between species and among individuals exhibiting differential susceptibility.

# In this wiki, you will find:

* The different pipelines used for genome assembly of Pinna nobilis (see the [README_GENOMIC](genomics/README_GENOMIC.md) section),

* Explanations of the software and computational tools employed in these analyses (see the [genomic](genomics/) section),

* The code used for genome-related analyses (see the [script](genomics/Script_classification.md) section).

You will also find similar explanations and scripts related to the identification of bacterial communities associated with Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis tissues in the [bacteria](Bacteria/) section.
