# Wiki noble pen shell
------------------------
This wiki has been created as part of a research project investigating the impact of the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae on the transcriptome of noble pen shell populations (Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis). The study is conducted under the supervision of Stéphane Coupé.

The objectives are, firstly, to identify transcriptomic mutations in Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis in response to infection by the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, and secondly, to compare the bacterial taxonomic groups between sensitive and resistant individuals of these two noble pen shell species.

Haplosporidium pinnae is a parasitic protozoan that infects the Mediterranean endemic bivalve Pinna nobilis (and its closely related species Pinna rudis), commonly known as the noble pen shell (Linnaeus, 1758). This infection is responsible for mass mortality events (MMEs) in noble pen shell populations and facilitates the entry of other pathogenic organisms, contributing to a multifactorial disease (Coupé et al., 2022).
Although some cases of resistance in P. nobilis and tolerance in P. rudis and P. nobilis × P. rudis hybrids have been reported, the latter two appear to be naturally resistant to the parasite (Coupé et al., 2022).

In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying tolerance and resistance, it is essential to investigate genomic variations both between species and among individuals exhibiting differential susceptibility.

The transcriptomes used were obtained from the NCBI SRA and can be found in the 'Selected transcriptomes' section.
