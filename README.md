# Wiki noble pen shell
------------------------
This wiki has been created as part of a research project investigating the impact of the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae on the transcriptome of noble pen shell populations (Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis). The study is conducted under the supervision of Stéphane Coupé.

This study aims, firstly, to characterize the transcriptomic responses of Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis to infection by the protozoan parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, and secondly, to identify the differentially expressed genes associated with the immune response. 

Haplosporidium pinnae is a parasitic protozoan that infects the Mediterranean endemic bivalve Pinna nobilis (and its closely related species Pinna rudis), commonly known as the noble pen shell (Linnaeus, 1758). This infection is responsible for mass mortality events (MMEs) in noble pen shell populations and facilitates the entry of other pathogenic organisms, contributing to a multifactorial disease (Coupé and al., 2022).

The transcriptomes used were obtained from the NCBI SRA and can be found in the 'Selected transcriptomes' section.
