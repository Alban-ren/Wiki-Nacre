In parallel with the transcriptomic analysis of Pinna nobilis, a study of the bacterial diversity associated with the mantle tissues of these organisms was conducted to determine whether the bacterial communities differ between healthy individuals and those infected by the parasite Haplosporidium pinnae. To this end, output files generated by Kraken2 (see [Kraken2](./Kraken_2.md#Kraken2) section), containing the bacterial taxa identified in the transcriptomes, were used as a basis for analysis. Each output file lists the bacterial taxa detected and the number of reads assigned to each.

In the Bash script below, a minimum threshold of 10 reads was established to reduce the likelihood of false positives due to taxonomic misassignments. This threshold is arbitrary, as there is currently no consensus regarding metagenomic identification in non-targeted transcriptomic datasets generated by Illumina sequencing.

Bacterial taxa with read counts equal to or above this threshold were selected and used to construct a presence/absence matrix. In this matrix, columns represent the different samples and rows correspond to the identified bacterial taxa. The presence of a taxon in a sample is marked with a “1” in the corresponding cell, while its absence is marked with a “0”. The full script used to generate this matrix is available in the “[Script bash bacteria](./Script_bash_bacteria.sh)” section.

The resulting binary matrix summarizes the presence or absence of bacterial taxa across samples. The objective is to compare bacterial diversity among samples in relation to biological, ecological, or geographic factors. Beta diversity analysis is particularly appropriate for this type of data, as it quantifies variation in species composition between samples or sites of interest (Legendre & De Cáceres, 2013).
