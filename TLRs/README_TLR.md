This section describes the identification and classification (according to Gerdol et al.,2017) of the genes encoding TLRs in the genomes of Pinna nobilis and Pinna rudis.

TLRs (Toll-Like Receptor) consist of three domains: an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR-DC). When the receptor binds to extracellular ligands such as bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), the β-sheets of the TIR domain undergo a structural rearrangement, inducing a conformational change and interacting with intracellular adaptor proteins (Gerdol et al., 2017).

There are five major families of these cytosolic adaptor proteins: MyD88, MAL, TRIF, TRAM, and SARM (O’Neill & Bowie, 2007). These proteins play a central role in the TLR signaling cascade, acting as modular platforms that relay signals from the TIR domains to intracellular signaling pathways (O’Neill & Bowie, 2007). In addition to transmitting the signal, these adaptors can also modulate it. For example, SARM acts as a negative regulator within the TRIF pathway to prevent excessive immune responses, particularly in neuronal cells (O’Neill & Bowie, 2007). Thus, these adaptors not only relay information but also help regulate the intensity and duration of the immune response (Gerdol et al., 2017).

Recent studies have highlighted an expansion of TIR-DC proteins in bivalves, reflected by an increase in the number of genes encoding TIR-DC proteins, including both transmembrane TLR receptors and intracellular TIR-DC proteins (Gerdol et al., 2017). Bivalve TLRs are characterized by a high structural diversity, including atypical combinations of TIR and LRR domains, potentially allowing broader recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Gerdol et al., 2017).

Bivalves possess a large number of intracellular TIR-DC proteins, whose structures differ from known vertebrate adaptors such as MyD88, TRIF, TRAM, and SARM. Among these proteins, several novel families, called ecTIR-DC, have been identified, suggesting potentially new roles in immune signaling, independent of the classical MyD88-TRIF pathways (Gerdol et al., 2017).

This diversification may be explained by lineage-specific gene expansion events in bivalves, likely in response to specific pressures of the marine environment, thus promoting the emergence of new proteins capable of detecting and responding to pathogens (Gerdol et al., 2017).
